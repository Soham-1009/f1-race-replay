"""
TCP socket transport for the telemetry stream.

The legacy code (``src.services.stream.TelemetryStreamServer``)
had a number of lifecycle problems:

* No SO_REUSEADDR — the port could be in TIME_WAIT after a
  crash and the server would refuse to bind.
* No accept timeout — the accept thread could block forever
  during shutdown, hanging the process.
* One passive per-client thread that just slept (``time.sleep(1)``)
  in a loop, never detecting peer disconnects promptly.
* No explicit lifecycle states.
* No way to recover a real port after a bind failure (e.g. the
  port is already in use).
* No port reporting — callers had to assume the configured port.

This module fixes all of the above:

* Explicit lifecycle: ``INIT | STARTING | RUNNING | STOPPING | STOPPED``.
* ``setsockopt(SO_REUSEADDR, 1)`` before bind.
* Bound ``accept()`` with a timeout, polled by a single dispatcher.
* Per-client queue + bounded send with a short timeout; a slow
  client is dropped after ``SEND_TIMEOUT_S`` and the queue is
  rotated.
* The actual bound port is reported (supports ``port=0`` for
  ephemeral port discovery, common in tests).
* Clean shutdown: ``stop()`` closes every client socket, joins
  the dispatcher thread, and closes the listening socket.
